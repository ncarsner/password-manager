# Secure Password Manager with GUI Interface

#### 1. Requirements
- [ ] **Security**: Use strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) for storing passwords.
- [ ] **User Authentication**: Implement a master password for accessing the password manager.
- [ ] **Password Generation**: Provide a feature to generate strong passwords.
- [ ] **Password Storage**: Securely store passwords in an encrypted database.
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Ensure the application works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [ ] **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly GUI for managing passwords.

#### 2. Tech Stack
- [ ] **Programming Language**: Python
- [ ] **GUI Framework**: Tkinter or PyQt
- [ ] **Database**: SQLite (encrypted with SQLCipher)
- [ ] **Encryption Library**: `cryptography` library in Python

#### 3. Project Setup
- [x] Create a new Python project.
- [x] Set up a virtual environment.
- [x] Create `requirements.txt` file with necessary libraries: `tkinter`, `pyqt5`, `cryptography`
- [ ] Import requirements from file

#### 4. Database Schema Design
- [ ] Create a table for storing passwords with fields for `id`, `service_name`, `username`, `password`, and `notes`.

#### 5. Implement Encryption and Decryption Functions
- [ ] Use the `cryptography` library to encrypt and decrypt passwords.

#### 6. GUI Development
- [ ] **Login Screen**: For master password entry.
- [ ] **Main Screen**: To display, add, edit, and delete passwords.
- [ ] **Password Generation**: A tool to generate strong passwords.

#### 7. Core Feature Implementation
- [ ] **User Authentication**: Verify the master password.
- [ ] **Password Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete passwords.
- [ ] **Password Generation**: Generate and copy strong passwords to the clipboard.

#### 8. Application Testing
- [ ] Perform unit tests and integration tests.
- [ ] Ensure encryption and decryption work correctly.
- [ ] Validate the GUI functionality.

#### 9. Packaging
- [ ] Use tools like PyInstaller to create executable files for different platforms.

#### 10. Documentation
- [ ] Write user documentation and provide instructions for installation and usage.
